#### Schedule
This was a school project, part of a course on artificial intelligence. It was created over a period of a few months.

#### Context
In our AI course we learned about the mathematical background of AI, as well as different types of AI. In order to pass the course, we had to create an AI-related programme as a team of four to six people.
In our case, we were a group of four and I was the project leader. This was partly because I was the only one with previous experience of using Godot.

#### Aim
The aim of the project was to use an AI-related algorithm or method and then present it. The idea for the project was to make a traffic light controller that would be trained using reinforcement learning.

This idea was nice because it involved concepts that several members of the team enjoyed: code that "evolves" and game development.

We first had to create a traffic flow simulator and then use it to apply reinforcement learning to a traffic light at an intersection.

The goal of the controller was to optimize traffic flow while avoiding accidents.

#### Functionality and use
The traffic simulator made in Godot allows us to create the environment. The simulator supports one to many lanes, with multiple intersections. However, it remained in a rather primitive state, so a lot of manual tweaking was required if you wanted to create many different environments. But once created, the environment could be used for training and running simulations without further fuss.

Once this was done, we were able to use the Godot RL Agents library to define our traffic light controller, train it and run inference.

In the end, we were able to train a model on a very simple intersection, and it showed some promise. But our simulation was still quite simple, so scaling up the process would obviously require some work.
