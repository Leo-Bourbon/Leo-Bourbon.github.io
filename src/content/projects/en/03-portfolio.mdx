#### Schedule
My personal portfolio was created over the course of almost a month and a half.

#### Context
The last three years of the work/study programme for my engineering degree were very intense, but I really enjoyed them. After graduating at the beginning of September, I was now free to take some time for myself and make up for the paid holidays I had not taken. I decided to take September and October off in order to be in good shape afterwards.

Towards the end of October, I decided that creating a personal portfolio website would be a worthwhile endeavour for my future job search.

#### Aim
When I started designing my portfolio, I had some clear goals in mind:
- It should be as fast and light as possible
- It had to be responsive on most (if not all) popular device resolutions, from smartphones to desktop computers. 
- Accessibility should not be compromised when using techniques such as animation.
- It needs to be easily maintainable and extensible, so that I can develop it as I go.
- It should be a good first introduction to some of my skills and personality.
- Since it is also made with job prospects in mind, having the site in English was a must. But I also wanted to have it in French.
- I also wanted to take the opportunity to use the Astro framework, as I had not done any big projects with it before.

#### Functionality and usage
The end result is this website that you are currently browsing. I am happy to say that all of the above goals have been achieved. If you find something wrong, please contact me so I can fix it, thank you !
Some highlights are:
- The use of layouts, which allowed me to centralize the logic for handling different screen sizes in one place, for easier maintenance.
- The internationalization with i18n, which allows me not to duplicate pages for different languages, but only to fill in translation files as needed. This makes it easy to add more languages in the future.
- The use of content collections, a feature of Astro that allows me to define my projects in MDX files and then use this data to generate the project pages and maps used. This means that I can easily edit, add or remove projects (and all the information associated with them, such as their images).
- The use of Github Pages, which allows me to easily manage the deployment and versioning of the site.
