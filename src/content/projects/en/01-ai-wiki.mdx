#### Timeframe
This project was carried out over the course of one month as part of my final year project for my engineering degree. You can see the [\[IA\]ssistant project](/en/projects/00-iassistant) for more information about my final year project.

#### Context
My role was to take the lead on AI to steer efforts towards positive outcomes. This involved both educating our staff on the subject and carrying out the necessary technical research. You can read more about my final year project in the [\[IA\]ssistant project](/en/projects/00-iassistant).

To educate our staff, I gave introductory talks on AI, created illustrations and organised workshops. This website is a sort of companion piece to my introductory presentations, allowing people to consult it afterwards and have a solid knowledge base covering the basics that were presented. 

#### Aim
The aim of this website is to act as a sort of wiki, so that people can consult it if they have any questions or want to learn more about some of the more basic concepts related to AI.

Participants in the presentations and workshops will find that the website follows a similar outline. It covers some basic definitions of AI, some key dates in a timeline format, an interaction catalogue covering keywords and areas, and ends with some case studies of current AI use in some companies.

For the catalogue page in particular, there was a need to be able to quickly edit the content to keep the information up to date and to add new relevant techniques or areas.

#### Functionality and use
To make it as easy as possible to maintain and edit the website, the website content is automatically generated from the content of an Excel document.

The spreadsheet format used by Excel makes it easy to edit the information within, which in turn makes it easy to edit the website content. This allows the website to be quickly updated or modified, particularly the catalogue section.

The catalogue has both an interactive tree map that allows you to quickly see and explore the relationships between the main fields and techniques related to AI. For each of these, there is an associated definition and links to additional external resources about it. There is also a search bar to quickly find a particular field or technique that a user may have heard of but not know what it is.
